        %h2 First
        You need to tell me the location of a KSP install
        .small This needs to be a full path ie 'c:\games\KSPv0.20.2' or 'r:\games\my_fav_game' or wherever you keep it.
        .small If you have multiple instances of KSP you can set those up later.

        - content_for :information do
          .vblk_1
          %h3 Just so you know;
          In each folder found in saves (apart from scenarios and training), I will create a git repository that will be used to track your craft.
          .small It will create a hidden .git folder in each campaign folder.  For the love of Jeb do not alter the contents of that folder!

          %h3 You Need
          to make sure jeb_watch.exe is also running.  jeb_watch monitors your craft for changes and updates the repository and database.

          %p When you click OK you will see a page that will list the campaigns found in the KSP install you entered above.  If you have craft in these they will be added to the repo and database, if you have lots of craft this might take a minute or two.

          %h2 GIT
          %p git is a version control system used by many developers to track the changes they make, it's the one that Squad currently use.
          %p It tracks save points or 'commits' for files as you edit them and allows you to return a file to how it was at any one of the previous commits.
          %p git only tracks the difference between commits, so only the lines of a file which have changed are stored, the parts which remain the same are not needlessly stored multiple times.  Its much more efficient than just taking a copy of the file each time.
          %p But git is a developers tool and if you like command line tools it's wonderful, to everyone else its not exactly user friendly.  Which is why I made Jebretary to automate using git and provide a (hopefully) simpler interface.
